# Project Overview

The Right Bite is your food suggestion app that will help you discover the perfect meal based on your cravings, dietary preferences, and time of day. Whether you're looking for a quick snack, a heavy meal, or even something healthy, The Right Bite provides personalized recommendations by considering your tastes based on the time of day.


The application was created according with the assignment's specifications, which included using GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, as well as developing a working mobile application.

```

Why:
----
A food meal recommendation software provides meal suggestions based on user interests, dietary requirements, and item availability to assist users in making meal decisions.  By offering fast and simple meal ideas, creating grocery lists, and recommending affordable choices, it may save time.  By providing individualized recommendations and nutritional insights, the app may also aid with health objectives.  By suggesting meals that make use of leftover items, it can also help cut down on food waste.  AI-powered tools can eventually learn user preferences to offer more intelligent, personalized food suggestions.

4. Design Considerations
------------------------

```markdown
## Design Considerations

The design of the **The Right Bite** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: In order to provide a smooth user experience, the app was created with the intention of offering an intuitive and simple-to-navigate interface.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: With special attention to device compatibility, the app was developed to make sure it functions properly on a variety of screen sizes.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**:Code optimization was taken into account to guarantee quick reaction times and minimal battery use.
```

Why:
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices. It demonstrates that students are considering not just the functionality, but also the usability and performance aspects of the app, which is a professional approach.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow streamlines the process of sending the final APK/AAB files for submission and guarantees that my project is automatically created and tested each time I push modifications.
```

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: A challenge i faced while making this was my app crashing alot of time while running a final version on android to see the results.
   - **Solution**: i asked more experienced people in coding for help with my codes and help me identify my errors which was simply spelling of certain words like capitalisation.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: White screen emulator error
   - **Solution**: i asked my lectuerer Mr Jessel Sookha to give me suggestions on my problems and i asked chapgpt to explain my error in simplier term and got code suggestionsthat could possibly help me.

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [newer look, "This will give a newer aestetic look with personized features like changing the background and color themes"]
2. **Feature 2**: [Chatbot, "Use chatbots to provide rapid access to customer service, recipe recommendations, and information."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Progress tracker, "Integrate with other fitness applications to assist users in monitoring their progress toward their health and fitness objectives."]

```
